## **Vehicle Detection Project**


The goals / steps of this project are the following:

* Perform a Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) feature extraction on a labeled training set of images and train a classifier Linear SVM classifier
* Apply a color transform and append binned color features, as well as histograms of color, to your HOG feature vector. 
* Implement a sliding-window technique and use your trained classifier to search for vehicles in images.
* Run pipeline on a video stream and create a heat map of recurring detections frame by frame to reject outliers and follow detected vehicles.
* Estimate a bounding box for vehicles detected.

## [Rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/513/view) Points

Here I will consider the rubric points individually and describe how I addressed each point in my implementation.  

## Writeup / README

First, to find Cars in images, I got information related to color, saturation, and luminosity for each car and non car example extracting a histogram and use it to create a feature vector. Here is a example: 

![alt text][histogram]

After that, Define a function to compute color features, given a color_space flag as 3-letter all caps string
like 'HSV', 'LUV', 'HLS', 'YUV', 'YCrCb'. In this function it's possible define a new size to reduce the total amount of features without lose relevant informations. Here is a example:

## Importing Data

To feed our algorithm we have two option of dataset: a Small used to test and tune the algorithm, and a full to create a more robust classifier.

Data can be downloaded at,

**Small Dataset:** 

[Vehicles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles_smallset.zip)
[Non-Vehicles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles_smallset.zip)

**Full Dataset:**

[Vehicles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/vehicles.zip)
[Non-Vehicles](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-sdc/Vehicle_Tracking/non-vehicles.zip)


In final version I used the full datase to train algorithm that contains: 

 8792  examples of Cars 
 8968  examples of Non Cars

### Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG)

Color Histograms do not capture information about shape of objetcs, so I compute a [Histogram of Oriented Gradient](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/auto_examples/features_detection/plot_hog.html) to extract this information and like I did with Color Histogram use it as feature to feed our classifier.


```python

def get_hog_features(img, orient, pix_per_cell, cell_per_block, vis=False, feature_vec=True):
    if vis == True:
        # Extract features and Hog Image
        features, hog_image = hog(img, orientations=orient, pixels_per_cell=(pix_per_cell, pix_per_cell),
                                  cells_per_block=(cell_per_block, cell_per_block), transform_sqrt=False, 
                                  visualise=True, feature_vector=False)
        return features, hog_image
    else:
        # Extract features and Hog Image
        features = hog(img, orientations=orient, pixels_per_cell=(pix_per_cell, pix_per_cell),
                       cells_per_block=(cell_per_block, cell_per_block), transform_sqrt=False, 
                       visualise=False, feature_vector=feature_vec)
        return features
 ```

####1. Explain how (and identify where in your code) you extracted HOG features from the training images.

The code for this step is contained in the first code cell of the IPython notebook (or in lines # through # of the file called `some_file.py`).

## Combine and Normalize Features

To feed our classifier we need the most possible number of features, in this project I used use 3 types:

* **Spatial Binning of Color:** which allow us perform a template match. This is not the best way because don't it takes into account changes of shape or variations, but still usefull to improve our algorithm.


* **Color Histogram :** Capture signature of color, saturation and luminosity of car and non car examples.


* **Histogram of Oriented Gradient:** Capture information about shape of car and non car examples.


To use all this features I defined functions to extract each feature and one function to merge in one feature vector for image.



```python

# Define a function to compute binned color features  
def bin_spatial(img, size=(32, 32)):
    # Use cv2.resize().ravel() to create the feature vector
    features = cv2.resize(img, size).ravel() 
    # Return the feature vector
    return features

```

```python

# Define a function to compute color histogram features  
def color_hist(img, nbins=32, bins_range=(0, 256)):
    # Compute the histogram of the color channels separately
    channel1_hist = np.histogram(img[:,:,0], bins=nbins, range=bins_range)
    channel2_hist = np.histogram(img[:,:,1], bins=nbins, range=bins_range)
    channel3_hist = np.histogram(img[:,:,2], bins=nbins, range=bins_range)
    # Concatenate the histograms into a single feature vector
    hist_features = np.concatenate((channel1_hist[0], channel2_hist[0], channel3_hist[0]))
    # Return the individual histograms, bin_centers and feature vector
    return hist_features
    
```

Instead extract feature function, now we'll define a function to extract the 3 types of features from a single image and concatenate this features just one feature vector.

After that, we'll define a function that gives a list of windows looking for cars in each of them.

```python

def single_img_features(img, color_space='RGB', spatial_size=(32, 32),
                        hist_bins=32, orient=9, 
                        pix_per_cell=8, cell_per_block=2, hog_channel=0,
                        spatial_feat=True, hist_feat=True, hog_feat=True):    
    #1) Define an empty list to receive features
    img_features = []
    #2) Apply color conversion if other than 'RGB'
    if color_space != 'RGB':
        if color_space == 'HSV':
            feature_image = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HSV)
        elif color_space == 'LUV':
            feature_image = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2LUV)
        elif color_space == 'HLS':
            feature_image = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2HLS)
        elif color_space == 'YUV':
            feature_image = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2YUV)
        elif color_space == 'YCrCb':
            feature_image = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_RGB2YCrCb)
    else: feature_image = np.copy(img)      
    #3) Compute spatial features if flag is set
    if spatial_feat == True:
        spatial_features = bin_spatial(feature_image, size=spatial_size)
        #4) Append features to list
        img_features.append(spatial_features)
    #5) Compute histogram features if flag is set
    if hist_feat == True:
        hist_features = color_hist(feature_image, nbins=hist_bins)
        #6) Append features to list
        img_features.append(hist_features)
    #7) Compute HOG features if flag is set
    if hog_feat == True:
        if hog_channel == 'ALL':
            hog_features = []
            for channel in range(feature_image.shape[2]):
                hog_features.extend(get_hog_features(feature_image[:,:,channel], 
                                    orient, pix_per_cell, cell_per_block, 
                                    vis=False, feature_vec=True))      
        else:
            hog_features = get_hog_features(feature_image[:,:,hog_channel], orient, 
                        pix_per_cell, cell_per_block, vis=False, feature_vec=True)
        #8) Append features to list
        img_features.append(hog_features)

    #9) Return concatenated array of features
    return np.concatenate(img_features)
    
```

I then explored different color spaces and different `skimage.hog()` parameters (`orientations`, `pixels_per_cell`, and `cells_per_block`).  I grabbed random images from each of the two classes and displayed them to get a feel for what the `skimage.hog()` output looks like.

Here is an example using the `YCrCb` color space and HOG parameters of `orientations=8`, `pixels_per_cell=(8, 8)` and `cells_per_block=(2, 2)`:

####2. Explain how you settled on your final choice of HOG parameters.

I tried various combinations of parameters and...

####3. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you trained a classifier using your selected HOG features (and color features if you used them).

I trained a linear SVM using...

###Sliding Window Search

####1. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented a sliding window search.  How did you decide what scales to search and how much to overlap windows?

I decided to search random window positions at random scales all over the image and came up with this (ok just kidding I didn't actually ;):

![alt text][image3]

####2. Show some examples of test images to demonstrate how your pipeline is working.  What did you do to optimize the performance of your classifier?

Ultimately I searched on two scales using YCrCb 3-channel HOG features plus spatially binned color and histograms of color in the feature vector, which provided a nice result.  Here are some example images:

### Video Implementation

####1. Provide a link to your final video output.  Your pipeline should perform reasonably well on the entire project video (somewhat wobbly or unstable bounding boxes are ok as long as you are identifying the vehicles most of the time with minimal false positives.)
Here's a [link to my video result](./project_video.mp4)


####2. Describe how (and identify where in your code) you implemented some kind of filter for false positives and some method for combining overlapping bounding boxes.

I recorded the positions of positive detections in each frame of the video.  From the positive detections I created a heatmap and then thresholded that map to identify vehicle positions.  I then used `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` to identify individual blobs in the heatmap.  I then assumed each blob corresponded to a vehicle.  I constructed bounding boxes to cover the area of each blob detected.  

Here's an example result showing the heatmap from a series of frames of video, the result of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` and the bounding boxes then overlaid on the last frame of video:

### Here are six frames and their corresponding heatmaps:

![alt text][image5]

### Here is the output of `scipy.ndimage.measurements.label()` on the integrated heatmap from all six frames:
![alt text][image6]

### Here the resulting bounding boxes are drawn onto the last frame in the series:

###Discussion

####1. Briefly discuss any problems / issues you faced in your implementation of this project.  Where will your pipeline likely fail?  What could you do to make it more robust?

Here I'll talk about the approach I took, what techniques I used, what worked and why, where the pipeline might fail and how I might improve it if I were going to pursue this project further.
